1. Introduction to Spring Framework
What is Spring Framework?
Spring Framework is a lightweight, open-source Java framework used to build enterprise-level applications.

It helps developers by:
Reducing boilerplate code
Providing loose coupling
Making applications easy to test and maintain

Spring follows two main principles:
Inversion of Control
Dependency Injection

2. Spring Modules Overview
Spring is modular, meaning you can use only what you need.

Major Spring Modules
1. Spring Core
Provides core functionality of Spring
Implements IoC and DI
Contains:
BeanFactory
Dependency Injection
Core utilities
2. Spring Context
Builds on Core module
Provides ApplicationContext
Supports:
Event handling
Annotation-based configuration

3. Spring Beans
Responsible for:
Creating beans
Managing bean lifecycle
Dependency injection

4. Spring MVC
Used to build web applications
Based on Model–View–Controller design pattern
Handles:
HTTP requests
Controllers
Views (JSP, Thymeleaf)
REST APIs

3. Inversion of Control (IoC)
What is IoC?
IoC means control of object creation is given to Spring, not the programmer.

Instead of:
Car car = new Car();
Spring does:
Creates object
Manages object
Injects dependencies


How Spring Implements IoC :

Spring uses:
BeanFactory
ApplicationContext

Spring reads configuration and:
Creates objects
Injects dependencies
Manages lifecycle

4. Dependency Injection (DI)
What is Dependency Injection?
DI means injecting required objects into a class instead of creating them manually.

Example
A Car needs an Engine.
Instead of:
Engine e = new Engine();
Spring injects it automatically.

Types of Dependency Injection
1. Constructor Injection
Dependencies provided through constructor
Recommended and safest

public Car(Engine engine) {
    this.engine = engine;
}
 Best for mandatory dependencies

2. Setter Injection
Dependency provided using setter method

public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
    this.engine = engine;
}
Used for optional dependencies

Difference:
 Constructor             Setter Injection
Constructor Injection	Setter Injection
Mandatory dependency	Optional dependency
Immutable object	     Mutable object

5. Spring Container
What is Spring Container?
Spring Container:
Creates beans
Manages lifecycle
Injects dependencies
Handles configuration

Types of Spring Container
1. BeanFactory
Basic container
Lightweight
Used in small applications

2. ApplicationContext
Advanced container
Eager loading
Supports:
Events
AOP
Annotations


Responsibilities of Spring Container:
Create objects
Inject dependencies
Manage bean lifecycle
Handle configuration
Destroy beans properly

6. Spring Beans Basics
What is a Spring Bean?
A Spring Bean is an object managed by Spring Container.

Example:
@Component
class Student {
}

Bean Configuration Approaches
1. XML Configuration
<bean id="car" class="com.Car"/>

2. Java Configuration
@Configuration
class Config {
   @Bean
   public Car car() {
      return new Car();
   }
}

3. Annotation-Based Configuration
@Component
@Service
@Repository
@Controller

@Component-Based Configuration :
@Component → Generic component
@Service → Business logic
@Repository → DAO layer
@Controller → Web controller

Spring automatically scans and creates beans.

7. Advantages of Spring Framework

Loose couplings
Easy dependency management
Reduces boilerplate code
Supports REST APIs
Easy testing (Mockito, JUnit)
Modular and lightweight
Supports transaction management
Integrates with Hibernate, JPA, JDBC
Industry standard for Java backend
